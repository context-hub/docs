# Research Module

The Research Module is a sophisticated framework for CTX that enables systematic knowledge discovery and strategic
analysis through AI-assisted workflows. It transforms unstructured exploration into organized research projects with
trackable artifacts, reusable templates, and contextual memory that persists across sessions.

## Overview

**Core Concept**: Research Module provides a structured approach to conducting strategic sessions with LLMs, capturing
insights as categorized entries, and maintaining research context for seamless continuation across multiple conversation
sessions.

## What Problem Does It Solve?

### The Challenge

When conducting strategic analysis or discovery work with LLMs:

- **Lost Context**: Information disappears between conversation sessions
- **Scattered Insights**: Findings are spread across multiple chats
- **No Structure**: Lack of systematic organization for discoveries
- **Difficulty Resuming**: Hard to continue work where you left off
- **No Progress Tracking**: Unable to measure completeness
- **One-time Use**: No way to reuse successful methodologies

### The Solution

Research Module provides:

- **Persistent Context**: Research memory and entries survive session boundaries
- **Structured Workflows**: Template-driven methodologies guide discovery
- **Organized Artifacts**: Categorized entries capture insights systematically
- **Session Continuity**: Resume research with full context restoration
- **Reusable Templates**: Apply proven methodologies to new projects
- **Strategic Guidance**: AI follows research-specific consultation patterns

## Use Cases

### 1. Product Feature Discovery

**Scenario**: Product manager wants to identify new features for their application.

**Process**:

- Create research from "Feature Discovery" template
- AI conducts strategic questioning about target audience
- Capture pain points, jobs-to-be-done, and feature ideas as entries
- Organize findings by category (audience research, needs analysis, ideation)
- Return later to review entries and continue with prioritization

### 2. Market Research

**Scenario**: Business analyst needs comprehensive market analysis.

**Process**:

- Use "Market Research" template
- AI guides through competitive analysis, market sizing, customer segments
- Document competitor profiles, market trends, and opportunities as entries
- Build complete market picture across multiple sessions
- Reference previous findings when developing strategy

### 3. Technical Architecture Planning

**Scenario**: Solution architect designing system architecture.

**Process**:

- Create research with "Architecture Design" template
- Explore requirements, constraints, and options through AI dialogue
- Capture architectural decisions, trade-offs, and specifications
- Maintain decision rationale for future reference
- Continue refinement across design iterations

### 4. Strategic Planning

**Scenario**: Executive team developing annual strategy.

**Process**:

- Use "Strategic Planning" template
- Work through SWOT analysis, scenario planning, initiative definition
- Document strategic options, decisions, and action plans
- Maintain strategic context as plans evolve
- Enable team collaboration across planning cycles
